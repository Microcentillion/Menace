Howdy.

Menace was created to allow you to control interaction with a web-page via PHP in a simple,
event-driven way. It is intended specifically to allow automated interaction with sites
without making it obvious that the site is being autonomously driven. This solution allows
HTTP referers for all content to remain intact, all form elements and scripts to work
without modification, and the browser useragent to be unmodified. In the end, there should
be no visible difference on the server end between a user controlling the page vs. another
machine.

inject.js - This is a GreaseMonkey script that must be loaded and targetted to the
individual site or sites you want to automate. It creates several methods for altering
the contents of form elements, and all the elements can be chained together. You MUST
modify the botTasks() function to include the URL for the server that will issue commands.

* NOTE: The 'trigger' method allows the automation to be event driven. All methods chained
behind it are queued until the trigger evaluates to true. If the trigger method is not
used, all the methods are executed immediately.

* WARNING: This script utilizes the advanced and unsafe 'GM_xmlhttpRequest' function.
This allows the script to perform cross-domain ajax requests, and obtain commands from
your control server. BE CERTAIN TO ONLY INSTALL THIS SCRIPT FOR THE PAGES YOU NEED IT ON.
